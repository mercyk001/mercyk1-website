      <p> Welcome to my personal website. My name is Mercy C Koech. I love capturing the beauty of the ocean and beautiful old buildings. The stillnes of the waves on calm day, the bouncing of light on the surface , the breeze from the ocean is something one shoul experience at least once in their lifetime. And for the buildings? Can you imagine the history it holds? And the details that went into creating such a beautiful masterpiece? I'm happy to share these moments with the world! </p>
